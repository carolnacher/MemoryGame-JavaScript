# Overview

I developed an interactive web application with JavaScript that offers two classic games: a memory game and a trivia quiz. Upon accessing the application, the user can choose the game they wish to play. Each game includes three difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard), designed to progressively challenge the player. The games are thematically focused on space exploration and astronomy, incorporating visually compelling elements and relevant content to enhance the user experience. The software demonstrates JavaScript functionality in DOM manipulation, event handling, state management, timing functions, and dynamic content rendering.
The project seeks to appeal to a broad audience, including children, teens, and adults, by offering engaging gameplay based on familiar formats. The application serves as a practical example of how to apply JavaScript to create interactive and user-friendly browser-based games.
